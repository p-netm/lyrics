(with Digital Farm Animals)
(feat. Nelly)

I feel like a millionaire
I feel like a millionaire
Whenever she comes around
Whenever I hear that sound
I feel like a millionaire
I feel like a millionaire
Whenever she comes around
Whenever I hear that sound

[Nelly:]
She smell like money when she walk by
All heat, no smoke, but she on fire
If they suicide doors, then she gon' ride
She got that passport pussy cause she don't fly, no love

She gon' make you pay to see you work it
She only twerk it for a Birkin
I gotta see if shawty worth it
Hey, she must be the money

I feel like a millionaire
I feel like a millionaire
Whenever she comes around
Whenever I hear that sound
I feel like a millionaire
I feel like a millionaire
Whenever she comes around
Whenever I hear that sound

[Nelly:]
Shawty work her way, the way she go down
Shawty worth her weight, her weight in gold pounds
Call me young money, put that milli on me
She the reason why I keep a milli on me
Shawty work her way, the way she go down
Shawty worth her weight, her weight in gold pounds
Call me young money, put that milli on me
Cause she the reason why I keep a milli on me

She gon' make you pay to see you work it
She only twerk it for a Birkin
I gotta see if shawty worth it
Hey, she must be the money
She must be the money
She must be the money
Shawty looking like money

I feel like a millionaire
